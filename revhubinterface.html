                REV Hub Interface: manual REV Expansion Hub control with no programming required
                <br><br>
                The REV Hub Interface is a piece of software allowing for a direct connection from a REV Expansion Hub and its peripherals to a PC.
                <br><br>
                This interface provides a method for teams to prototype with motors, servos, and sensors in a way that is faster and easier than setting
                up an entire robot control system.
                It is also a valuable troubleshooting tool that can help isolate the cause of an issue and determine
                if it is caused by hardware or by software.
                Firmware can also be updated and recovered through this interface as well as the Robot Controller Application.
                <br><br>
                This is a community continuation of the software, updating to newer underlying technologies
                (such as porting from Python 2 to Python 3), adding features,
                and porting to more platforms (Linux and macOS, in addition to Windows).
                Though initially created by REV,
                this version of the software is not maintained by or affiliated with REV.
                Do not contact REV support about any issues you experience with this software.
                <br><br>
                REV Hub Interface's code is public and available <a href="https://github.com/unofficial-rev-port/SerialHubControl">here.</a>
