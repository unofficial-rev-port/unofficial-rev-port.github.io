                    Welcome to the Unofficial REV Port Team website!
                    <br><br>
                    We are a group of passionate FTC and FRC students and alumni who wish to allow FIRST teams 
                    to use REV software on any OS, not just Windows. Our goal is to make FRC and FTC software 
                    available to all, no matter their platform or operating system, as well as doing our best
                    to keep current hardware relevant past the upcoming MRC switch for the 2027 FIRST season.

                        The REV Hardware Client is software for the configuration, updating, and management
                        of REV Robotics Hardware. From REV, it only has a Windows x86_64 build, meaning it will not work for
                        users with ARM CPUs or of Linux or macOS operating systems. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our port is now in progress, and once finished,
                        we will have to work with REV on the way to release once complete.

                        The REV Hub Interface allows you to control a REV Expansion Hub over USB. REV's version
                        has been useful for many teams, but has been mostly abandoned since at least 2022 and has several major bugs. It also only
                        had a Windows x86_64 build.
                        <br><br>
                        Our port is complete.
                        It features a new, modern GUI as well as several download options for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
                        We also have implemented many bugfixes and improvements,
                        such as updating python to a much more modern version,
                        improving the update time of hardware reads
                        to provide more up-to-date information,
                        and adding new features, like
                        motor PIDs!
                        The download is available <a href="https://github.com/unofficial-rev-port/REVHubInterface">on our GitHub,</a>

                        <br><br>
                        LibREVHub is an original piece of software based on the communications code from REV Hub Interface.
                        It separates the REV Hub Interface app from its internals allowing them to be
                        used in other contexts, such as a custom control system.
                        It features a completely rebuilt packet processing
                        function, a bulk read implementation,
                        and a user-facing SDK to interface with devices
                        <br><br>
                        Our port is now in progress, with bulk reads about half implemented,
                        communications a little bugged,
                        and no functioning REV Hub Interface build to go with it.
                        However, it is under active development.
