                <br><br>
                We are a team of FIRST students and alumni from both the FTC and FRC program and 
                we have a passion for robotics and making. Our goal is to make FRC and FTC software 
                available to all no matter their platform or operating system, as well as doing our best
                to keep current hardware realavent past the upcoming MRC switch for the 2027 FIRST season.

                    The REV Hardware Client is software for the configuration, updating, and management
                    of REV Robotics Hardware. From REV, it only has a Windows x86_64 build, meaning it will not work for
                    users with ARM CPUs or of Linux or MacOS operating systems. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our port is currently in progress, and once
                    finished we will have to work with REV on way to release once complete.

                    The REV Hub Interface is software that can control a REV Expansion Hub over USB serial. REV's version
                    has been useful for many teams, but has been mostly abandonded since at least 2022 and was buggy. It also only
                    had a windwos x86_64 build. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our port is complete, featuring a new, more modern gui, several packaging option on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. 
                    We also have implemented many bugfixes and improvements, such as running it on a much newer python version,
                    improving the update time of hardware reads to provide more up to date information, and adding new features, like 
                    motor pids! The download is available <a href="https://github.com/unofficial-rev-port/REVHubInterface">on our github,</a>
