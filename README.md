# Unofficial REV Robotics software port/development team
We are a team of FIRST Robotics students and alumni working to continue development of various software from REV Robotics and port it to other platforms. 

## [REV Hub Interface - Community Edition](https://github.com/unofficial-rev-port/REVHubInterface)

The REV Hub Interface is a Python program allowing for a direct connection from a REV Expansion Hub and its peripherals to a PC.

This interface provides a method for teams to prototype with motors, servos, and sensors in a way that is faster and easier than setting up an entire robot control system. It is also a valuable troubleshooting tool that can help isolate the cause of an issue and determine if it is electrical or software related. The REV Hub Firmware can also be updated and recovered through this interface in addition to the Robot Controller Application.

This is a community continuation of the software, updating to newer underlying technologies (e.g. porting from Python 2 to Python 3), adding features, and porting to more platforms (Linux and macOS, in addition to Windows). Though initially created by REV, this version of the software is not maintained by or affiliated with REV. Do not contact REV support about any issues you experience with this software, instead you may create a GitHub Issue or ask in https://discord.gg/pU2fesSTqF.

Downloads are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/unofficial-rev-port/REVHubInterface/releases) or from [PyPi/pip](https://pypi.org/project/REVHubInterface/). A Flathub release [is now available ](https://flathub.org/apps/org.unofficialrevport.REVHubInterface).

## [REV Hardware Client - Community Edition (Coming soon!)](https://github.com/unofficial-rev-port/REV-Hardware-Client)

The REV Hardware Client is an Electron program allowing for connection and management of various REV hardware from a PC.  Work in progress as of now.

## [librevhub (Coming soon!)](https://github.com/unofficial-rev-port/SerialHubControl)

A Python library for controlling a REV Expansion Hub.
